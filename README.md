🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application - Task 03 Completed! ✨

As part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech, I built an interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game using:

✅ HTML - For structuring the game board
✅ CSS - For styling and making the UI visually appealing
✅ JavaScript - For handling game logic, user interactions, and checking winning conditions

🕹 Key Features:
🔹 Players can play against each other
🔹 Tracks game state and detects winners
🔹 Interactive and engaging user experience

This task helped me improve my JavaScript skills, particularly in event handling, game state management, and logic implementation. Excited to continue building more interactive projects! 🚀💻
